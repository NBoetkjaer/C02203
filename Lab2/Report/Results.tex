\chapter{Results}
The Theory chapter \ref{chap:theory} gives a description on how the task of making an image accelerator for edge detection on a gray scale image can be solved. In this chapter test results from implementing the theory on a low budget FPGA \textit{The Xilinx FPGA on the Nexys 3 board} will be presented and discussed.  

\section{Implementation of Sobel operator with extensively extern memory transactions}
The basic design described in section \ref{sec:AccDesign} have been synthesised simulated and test on the \textit{Nexys board}. The synthesis report seen in figure \ref{fig:sum_synthesis_report}\\
